# exercise-tracker
 An app to track your exercises.

 I was inspired to build this full stack application due to getting back in the gym recently and wanting a different solution
 to tracking my workouts than just creating a new note every day in my phone. This seemed to be a great way to centeralize all
 of mine and my gym partners workouts to keep track of what we've done on what day, machines hit, etc. I built this app locally
 and then uploaded to GitHub. I will continue to work on it from here.

 This application was built with a MERN stack. Technologies include the following:

 MongoDB Atlas
 Mongoose
 Express JS
 React JS
 Node JS
 JavaScript

 After download, start server with nodemon and start client with npm start.
